# ⚠️ MISSING LOGO FILES

The landing page is looking for your logo files but they haven't been added yet!

## What's Missing:

You need to add these 2 logo files to the `public/assets/logos/` folder:

1. **gridtrack-logo.png** - Your full logo (text + icon)
   - Used in navbar (40px height)
   - Used in footer (32px height, inverted to white)

2. **gridtrack-icon.png** - Your icon only (no text)
   - Used as the browser favicon

## Where to Place Them:

```
public/
  └── assets/
      └── logos/
          ├── gridtrack-logo.png  ← Add your full logo here
          └── gridtrack-icon.png  ← Add your icon here
```

## Quick Fix:

If you have your logo files, save them to:
- **Full logo**: `public/assets/logos/gridtrack-logo.png`
- **Icon only**: `public/assets/logos/gridtrack-icon.png`

The dev server will automatically reload and show them!

## Screenshot Status ✅

The screenshot placeholders are already in place at:
- `public/assets/screenshots/timeline.png`
- `public/assets/screenshots/dashboard.png`
- `public/assets/screenshots/portfolios.png`

You can replace these with your actual screenshots whenever you're ready.
